## PHAR

The preferred method of installation is to use the PHPLint PHAR which can be downloaded from the most recent
[Github Release][releases]. This method ensures you will not have any dependency conflict issue.

**IMPORTANT** : Embedded with Composer dependencies that are PHP 8.2 compatible !

## Docker

You can install `phplint` with [Docker][docker]

```shell
docker pull overtrue/phplint:latest
```

## Phive

You can install `phplint` globally with [Phive][phive]

```shell
phive install overtrue/phplint --force-accept-unsigned
```

To upgrade global `phplint` use the following command:

```shell
phive update overtrue/phplint --force-accept-unsigned
```

You can also install `phplint` locally to your project with [Phive][phive] and configuration file `.phive/phars.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phive xmlns="https://phar.io/phive">
    <phar name="overtrue/phplint" version="^9.5" copy="false" />
</phive>
```

```shell
phive install --force-accept-unsigned
```

## Composer

You can install `phplint` with [Composer][composer]

```shell
composer global require overtrue/phplint ^9.5
```

If you cannot install it because of a dependency conflict, or you prefer to install it for your project, we recommend
you to take a look at [bamarni/composer-bin-plugin][bamarni/composer-bin-plugin]. Example:

```shell
composer require --dev bamarni/composer-bin-plugin
composer bin phplint require --dev overtrue/phplint

vendor/bin/phplint
```
